<h1>Cutting the Fluff with Aol</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>AOL Mail was one of the early pioneers of the internet and was at one point a giant in its industry. Reaching almost 50 million users in its prime, which was substantial for its time. However, today it only has about 1.5 million users. When compared to Google mail’s whopping 1.5 billion users, one might ask themselves “What went wrong?” In this case study my job was to streamline AOL Mail’s desktop design in order to help them get back in the fight.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>
<h3>First Impressions and Spring Cleaning</h3>
<p>At the start of the project, my team and I picked out elements that we felt were unnecessary for the primary function of the website such as the extra search bar, the calendar, the AOL newsroom, the excessive ads, several confusing icons, and some counterintuitive action buttons. Overall we felt like the website was cluttered and some of the designs were outdated.=</p>

<p>After our meeting we broke off to create several different designs to possibly use for the end product. As I was redesigning this website I began to realize the overarching problem. This website was trying to be too many things at once instead of focusing on its main purpose as an emailing platform. Unnecessary elements like the calendar, contacts, and newsroom distracted from the main content and created an environment where wayfinding was confusing and unnecessarily difficult.
    My design for the project cut out a lot of the “fluff” that was on the page. Many of the elements listed above were removed and many of the outdated icons, functionalities and designs were replaced. I also removed some of the border lines to give the site a more simplistic and modern look.</p>

<p>After we made our first designs we got together as a team to critique each other's designs. When we were finished with that, we split up to refine our designs and make a dark mode for the website. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, The greatest thing that I learned from this project was how important it is to have a main focus when designing a website. Without this, it is easy to lose sight of what the primary function of your product is. You will never be able to satisfy everyone, so it is essential to focus on satisfying your primary audience above all else. </p>

<h1>User Focused Design</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Starting college can be confusing and scary for first year students. It can be difficult to figure out what major to choose,what classes are required, and how to register for those classes. Fortunately the First Year Advising Center at UVU is here to help these new students with all of these things. Our goal in this project was to streamline the First Year Advising Center’s website in order to make it as easy as possible for these students to schedule an appointment with their first year advisor so that they can get on the right path to graduation.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>

<h3>Gathering Information</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the project we wanted to gather as much information as possible in order to be able to create a website that catered to the needs of our target audience. My team and I gathered together and created survey questions that would provide us with quantitative data and help us figure out what is most important to our users. After this we sent out our survey and gathered around 100 responses. We then each interviewed 2 people from our target audience with more in depth questions in order to gather qualitative data.</p>

<h3>Making a Plan</h3>
<p>My team and I then created a project brief with proto-personas, design principles, user interview and survey results, and our plans on how we were going to meet the needs of our target audience. We then took this project brief and presented it to our clients at the first year advising center. We then created heuristic markups of several pages on the old website in order to find places where we could improve upon the design.</p>

<h3>User Testing</h3>
<p>Before sketching and wireframing our designs, my team and I thought it would be best to conduct some user testing on the old design of the website. This was to help us discover things that users were having trouble with as well as things that users were completely overlooking. We set up several tests that would monitor user wayfinding by utilizing eye and face tracking technology. </p>
<p>In these tests we found that many of our users completely overlooked several parts of the website that contained key information. We also found that some key information was hidden in places that were not intuitive for users. This helped us to understand places where we could improve the design of the website and create a more user friendly experience overall.</p>

<h3>Creating Our Designs</h3>
<p>After all of the information gathering and testing we finally were able to get started on creating our designs for this project. We started out by sketching out possible designs on a whiteboard and choosing the best ones to turn into wireframes. </p>
<p>Each of us created mobile wireframes for key pages on the First Year Advising website. We then got together, compared designs, then picked bits and pieces of each other's designs that we thought were good and compiled them into a final wireframe. We followed the same process for the desktop designs.</p>

<p>After creating wireframes and agreeing on a final design, our next task was to fully hash these designs out into high fidelity surface comps. We pulled images and logos from the UVU gallery and copied the color scheme and typography in order to fit within UVU’s design standards. After we had each finished our assigned parts of the website we compiled our designs and started to work on creating a high fidelity prototype.</p>

<h3>Final Testing and Complete Designs</h3>
<p>After finishing our prototype, we decided to test our designs once more. We found that users had a much easier time navigating through the website and completing key tasks like scheduling an appointment with an advisor. In some cases the time to complete a task was cut in half or more.</p>
<p>We took some feedback from our testing and refined our designs even further. We completely overhauled the appointment scheduling process and made a few other minor changes with buttons and fonts. Once we had finished revising our work,  we presented our final designs to our clients and wrapped up the project.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There were many things that I learned from this study, one of them being the value in following a design process. Past projects where I did not follow a process always resulted in additional, unnecessary time and work that I had to put into that project. Though it may seem tedious, sticking to a process ultimately helped us to make more informed design choices that more fully catered to our users' needs.</p>
<p>Another thing that I learned was how much eye tracking technology can help you to figure out strengths and weaknesses of your website. Without the eye tracking tests that we conducted, it would have been a lot more difficult to find out what was holding users back from being able to use the website to its full potential. </p>

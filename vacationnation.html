<h1>The Value In Conventionality</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>In this case study I created a fictitious organization named Vacation Nation and designed a website that would be used for this company. As the name implies, this would be a website used for booking vacations. </p>
<p>First things first I got started on creating wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. I made pages for 5 tabs that would be included on this website. Namely the home, destination, travel, our mission, and support tabs.</p>
<div class="gallery">

    <img src="images/vacationnation/set1/s1-5.png" alt="Wireframes">
    <img src="images/vacationnation/set1/s1-6.png" alt="Wireframes">
</div>

<p>The home tab gave basic information about the company: their goals, their roots, and how to use the website. The Destinations tabs had information about the places that you could travel, travel packages you could buy and nearby attractions in the destination that you searched. The Travel page showed a map that highlighted airports, hotels, car rental dealerships and transit near your destination. The our mission tab contained information about the company’s vision and goals. And finally the support tab contained a form you could fill out to resolve issues with the website and FAQ’s.</p>
<p>After creating my first wireframes, I brought my designs to my team and asked them to critique them. We found that there were a lot of inconsistencies with spacing and some unnecessary icons that I fixed in my next rendition of wireframes.</p>

</div>

<h3>Planning the Atmosphere of the Site</h3>
<p>The next step was to create a logo, choose the fonts, and decide the color scheme of the website. I decided to make the logo relatively simple as seen in the photo below. I then based the color scheme of the website off of the logo and created a pattern library to build my website off of</p>

</div>

<h3>Making it a Reality</h3>
<p>After I had finished planning what fonts and colors to use in the website, I created my first surface comps. I made a couple changes from the wireframes, the biggest being changing the names for the tabs to minimize confusion with duplicate menu items on  the sidebar menu. I changed “destinations” to  “where to” and “travel” to “maps”. I also hashed out the rest of the content that was only implied in the mobile wireframes. </p>
<p>I then took my designs to my team to have them critique it once more before creating my final surface comps. This time around I decided to simplify the logo a bit by removing the blue square in the background. After that, as well as some finishing touches the design was finished.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the main thing that I learned from this project was how breaking conventional methods can cause problems. One of the biggest problems that I had with this design was the dual menus. If I were to do things over I would probably get rid of one of the menus in order to reduce confusion.</p>

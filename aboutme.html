<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>My name is Caeden Ward. I love spending time with my family and friends outdoors doing things like snowboarding, canyoneering, and bow-fishing. In my downtime I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing violin. </p>

<p>Technology has always been one of my greatest interests. Back in high school, I was introduced to a website called "Scratch." Essentially, it was a drag and drop coding experience and it was what initially got me thinking about doing something in the field of Web Design and Development. When I got started in the Web Design and Development program at UVU I found my passion for UX Design</p>

<p>During my time at UVU, I have learned a lot about both the design and development sides of creating websites. From design principles to media queries, I have picked up many skills that helped me to create more user friendly websites. I have strived to give my all with the work that I do and maintain excelletn grades. I hope to graduate with a Bachelors degree in Web Design and Development with an emphasis on Interaction and Design in the year 2024</p>

<p>Once I graduate I hope to find a fulfilling career where I can utilize the skills I have developed in school while also devloping new skills. Ultimately, I am looking for a postition that will enable me to create better, more user friendly websites in order to create an enhanced web experience for all. </p>

<h1>Building your Own Brand</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I started this project by creating sketches for many different renditions of the logo. I had my team critique my sketches then I chose the best designs to turn into black and white renditions. I followed the same process for the business cards and the mobile website design.</p>
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>I started this project by creating sketches for many different renditions of the logo. I had my team critique my sketches then I chose the best designs to turn into black and white renditions. I followed the same process for the business cards and the mobile website design.</p>

<p>After sketching out my designs and creating black and white renditions for the best designs, I created my first full color surface comps based off of the black and white designs.</p>

</div>


<p>After I had finished that, I brought my work to my team, they critiqued it, and I made improvements to create my final designs. I decided to add backgrounds to the logos to help them stand out more. I also got rid of some of the outlines to make it look more simplistic and modern.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Though this project was small in scope, I learned a very valuable lesson in how essential it is to create multiple renditions of your designs. When working for a client, you can often get an idea of what is expected from you, but only creating one design will seldom ever allow you to create something that completely satisfies them. Creating multiple designs and narrowing down the best renditions will help you to think outside of the box and create something that will truly please your clients.</p>

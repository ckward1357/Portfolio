<h1>Why Defining Expectations is Essential</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this study we were tasked with taking several components of a website provided by our client and incorporating them into a web app for Apartment Copilot. Unfortunately, we were not in contact with the client throughout the entire project, so we were left on our own to figure out how these components should work together. This constraint led to a lot of difficulties in our design process, causing us to revise our designs whenever new information was brought to the table. My role in this project was to take these unorganized components and group them together in a way that is both intuitive and user friendly, here are the steps that I took.</p>


<h2>What Happened</h2>
<h3>Creating the First Designs</h3>
<p>The first task we accomplished was to each create a design for a desktop version of Apartment Copilot using the components given to us. To our detriment, The PDF file that contained all of the components was little more than a loose collection of data. This lack of organization made it extremely difficult to understand which components were supposed to go together, much less what their functions were.</p>
<p> After closely examining the document, we made an educated guess on how the different components should be grouped and started to create our designs. I decided that the best way to organize this information was to use cards. </p>

<p>Once we had completed designs for both the desktop and mobile we got together as a team and critiqued each other's designs and suggested areas that could be improved. As we were doing this, we decided to take another look at the PDF document. After closer inspection, we came to the realization that many of the components we had put on the dashboard such as the pie chart, data table, and ratings table were not meant to be on a dashboard. Instead, we all agreed that this information would be better suited on a “detailed view” subpage of the properties page. We concluded that it would be best to start from scratch with a new design. We also decided that this project would be better suited as a web app rather than a desktop website so we focused on designs for mobile (though we would later include a desktop design just in case.) This time, instead of jumping right into creating designs, we felt it would be best to start with wireframes.</p>

<h3>Starting Fresh</h3>
<p>The dashboard was changed to display your assigned tasks from the log as well as information on new properties that are on the market. Along with this I also made some different design decisions that would improve upon my previous design. I changed the style of all of the lists so that they matched each other in order to maintain consistency. I replaced all of the icons so that they would match each other better. I sharpened the corners of the cards and reduced the drop shadow to make them look cleaner. I also completely redesigned the “people” page after coming to the realization that this list would be for members of your team and not for tenants.</p>

<h3>Final Designs</h3>
<p>After finishing our wireframes we once again gathered the team together and critiqued each other's designs. When we had finished this we all went off to create our final designs</p>
<p>In my final design I made more changes in my design to create a more user friendly experience. I got rid of cards in a lot of places where I deemed them unnecessary such as the lists on the mobile design. I also brought the lists on mobile all the way to the edges of the screen. This opened up a lot of real estate and helped the design to feel less cramped. Though the color scheme was the same as my first design, I changed up where I put the colors. For example, instead of a light gray, the side menu was now the same dark gray that is found in the logo. I changed the search bar on the desktop and mobile designs and added a “sort by” option. This new design conformed more to the overall feel of the website. I added a settings page to modify your account information and last of all I removed some elements that we as a team had deemed unnecessary such as the minus button on the log.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking back there were a lot of lessons to be learned from this experience, the first being how critical working closely with your clients is. Because of our lack of understanding we were severely limited in our ability to create a product that fulfills the purpose of its creation. A significant amount of time was wasted just trying to figure out how the pieces of this website were supposed to fit together. Another important lesson that was learned from this experience was how important it is to follow a set design process. Because we skipped a few steps such as sketching, and wireframing, our designs took a lot more refining to reach the end product. Had we made sketches and  wireframes from the very beginning, we would have saved a significant amount of time that we instead had to spend on restarting our project. </p>
<p>Overall, this project has made clear the value of communication and structure. Without these two key concepts, a lot of unnecessary time and effort will be wasted as you inevitably have to start from scratch again and again. It is easy to want to jump right into creating high fidelity designs for your website; however, taking the time to set clear expectations and making a plan to fulfill those expectations will ultimately take less time in the long run and will help you to create higher quality designs that will help you to accomplish your goals.</p>
